# TensorFlow.js Starter Projects

Welcome to the TensorFlow.js Starter Projects repository! This collection features three foundational projects designed to help you understand and utilize TensorFlow.js, the JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning and demonstrates practical implementations of various techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Image Classification with Pre-trained Models

**Description**: This project showcases how to leverage pre-trained models in TensorFlow.js for image classification tasks. Using a model like MobileNet, users can upload images and receive instant classification results without needing to train the model from scratch.


### 2. Transfer Learning with Custom Dataset

**Description**: This project demonstrates transfer learning techniques using TensorFlow.js, allowing users to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a custom dataset. By retraining the model, users can adapt it to recognize specific classes relevant to their application.


### 3. Building and Training a Custom Model

**Description**: This project focuses on building and training a custom model from scratch using TensorFlow.js. Users can define their model architecture and train it using their dataset, gaining insight into the model-building process and the various training techniques available.


**How to play**
1. cd to the project you want
2. run ```npm install
3. run ```npm run dev
